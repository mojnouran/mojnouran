## üë®‚Äçüíª Research and Development Projects

### Deep Learning Projects
- **[Interpretable Deep Neuro-Fuzzy Networks](https://google.com)**  
  Developed using PyTorch, this project focuses on transparent deep learning models for monitoring and control systems. 
- **[Gradient Vanishing and Privacy-Interpretability Trade-off in ANFIS](https://google.com)**  
  Research exploring adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference systems, with applications in federated learning. Part of my PhD dissertation. Email me and I'll send you fully reproducible codes, public datasets and the papers as soon as they become available online.

### Control Systems Tools
- **[Boundary and Optimal H‚àû Controller Design](https://google.com)**  
  Tools for distributed parameter systems, applied to solar ponds for energy efficiency. Based on my MSc thesis (Grade: 100/100).
- **[Automatic Control of Salinity Profile in Solar Ponds](https://google.com)**  
  Patent-pending system optimizing energy extraction from salt gradient solar ponds, implemented with simulation tools.
  
### Reinforcement Learning Projects
- **[N-Armed bandit problem](https://bitbucket.org/mojtaba-nourani/rl-n-arm-bandit/src/master/)**  
  Developed in Matlab, this project compares action selection methodologies to optimize the balance between exploration and exploitation in a multi-armed bandit problem, where repeated choices among n actions yield rewards from action-dependent stationary probability distributions.
  Andrew, B. and Richard S, S., 2018. Reinforcement learning: an introduction. Page 25.
- **[The Gambler's problem](https://bitbucket.org/mojtaba-nourani/rl-gambler-problem/src/master/)**  
  Developed in Matlab, this project models a gambler betting on coin flips as a finite MDP, aiming to maximize the probability of reaching $100 through optimal stake selection, solved via value iteration for a given heads probability (e.g., ph = 0.4). The RL book (above), Page 84

### Research Publications
- **[Gradient Vanishing, Autoencoder Initialization and Privacy-Interpretability Trade-off in Adaptive Neuro-Fuzzy Inference Systems](https://google.com)**
