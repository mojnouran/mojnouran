## üë®‚Äçüíª Research and Development Projects

### Deep Learning Projects with Manual Backpropagation
- **[Advanced Autoencoder Implementations](https://github.com/mojnouran/Basic_Neural_Net_ManualBP)**  
  Autoencoders with flexible neurons, RBF neurons and dropout, and design of robust autoencoders. Developed using MATLAB with manual backpropagation.
- **[Recurrent Neural Networks](https://github.com/mojnouran/Basic_Neural_Net_ManualBP)**  
  Elman and Jordan Autoencoders with separate dense layers, and hybrid architectures combining Elman/Jordan feedback mechanisms. Implemented from scratch in MATLAB.
- **[LSTM Autoencoders](https://github.com/mojnouran/Basic_Neural_Net_ManualBP)**  
  Long Short-Term Memory autoencoder architectures with customized memory cells for sequential data processing. Complete MATLAB implementation with manual backpropagation.
- **[Explainable CNN](https://github.com/mojnouran/Basic_Neural_Net_ManualBP)**  
  Deep Convolutional Neural Networks with explainable gradient monitoring for interpretability and feature map analysis. The code derived from the Paper Yeganejou, M., Dick, S. and Miller, J., 2019. Interpretable deep convolutional fuzzy classifier. IEEE transactions on fuzzy systems, 28(7), pp.1407-1419.

  
### Reinforcement Learning Projects
- **[N-Armed bandit problem](https://bitbucket.org/mojtaba-nourani/rl-n-arm-bandit/src/master/)**  
  Developed in Matlab, this project compares action selection methodologies to optimize the balance between exploration and exploitation in a multi-armed bandit problem, where repeated choices among n actions yield rewards from action-dependent stationary probability distributions.
  
  The RL book: Andrew, B. and Richard S, S., 2018. Reinforcement learning: an introduction. Page 25.
- **[The Gambler's problem](https://bitbucket.org/mojtaba-nourani/rl-gambler-problem/src/master/)**  
  This project models a gambler betting on coin flips as a finite MDP, aiming to maximize the probability of reaching $100 through optimal stake selection, solved via value iteration for a given heads probability (e.g., ph = 0.4). The RL book (above), Page 84. PS: I argue that this implementation is the most compact solution you can find on the web.
- **[The Grid World's problem](https://bitbucket.org/mojtaba-nourani/rl-deterministic-grid-world/src/master/)**  
This project evaluates a gridworld MDP where an agent moves deterministically in four directions, earning rewards (+10 from A, +5 from B) or penalties (-1 at edges), with the state-value function computed for a random policy using a discount factor of 0.9. (Refer to page 60 of the RL book)
- **[Recycling Robot](https://bitbucket.org/mojtaba-nourani/rl-recycling-robot/src/master/)**  
Accumulated reward for an FMDP (Refer to page 52 of the RL book)
- **[Random Walk](https://bitbucket.org/mojtaba-nourani/rl-random-walk/src/master/)**  
Estimating the value function based on Temporal difference and Monte Carlo tree search. Page 125 of the RL book (above)
